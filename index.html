        Purpose of this page
      </h2>
      <p>
        I've been asked a number of times recently to both explain Flocktracker and to explain the work I am currently doing with regards to it. As a result, I have found myself writing a number of long emails and figured the best solution to remedy this - both in terms of saving my time and to help me craft a clear, simple "story" of my work thus far with Flocktracker is to make a simple page doing just that.

        Flocktracker is a smartphone based application designed to read your traditional pen and paper survey and convert it into a dynamic, interactive smartphone-based survey tool that combines dynamic trip data, along with anything from ridership to counts to vehicle speed to create rich, robust data sets that lend new insight and analytical potential to your research endeavors. This data is visible live and, combined with a forthcoming Dashboard system, will build off of current visualization provisions to enable operators to monitor the locations of their surveyors, as well as broadcast live, up-to-the-second updates on desired aggregate data metrics.

      Origins of Flocktracker
    </h2>
    <div class="l-box-lrg pure-u-1">
      <h4>Initial Development</h4>
      <p>
        Flocktracker started as a project under Albert Ching and Stephen Kennedy in the Planning Department at MIT. Albert had worked at Google prior to entering the Master's program at MIT and had extensive experience in India and Bangladesh. His travel and work there made it an area of focus that he set about expanding upon through his research with Prof. Chris Zegras. Through Albert's <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/77836?show=full">thesis</a> work, he and Stephen scoped out and piloted an early version of Flocktracker using MIT's App Inventor software, which enables the creation of simple applications for Android using an intuitive graphical interface to abstract code development.
      </p>
      <h4>The Beginning of My Work with Flocktracker</h4>
      <p>
        It was at this point that I joined on, in the Fall of 2012. With Albert and Stephen, our first goal was to stabilize the alpha version of the application and use it in an aggressive first full roll out - the mapping of the bus network of Dhaka, Bangladesh. This project occurred over the January IAP period in 2013 and was funded in part by a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/urbanlaunchpad/first-bus-map-of-dhaka">successful Kickstarter campaign</a>. On this project, I served as the lead coordinator in Dhaka, arranging the teams and managing the data produced by my team members. I also spent days riding the buses myself, assisting in the production of the map. Over the course of the Spring of 2013, Stephen and I parsed through the data and stitched together a complete bus map of Dhaka, which was printed thousands of times and distributed both physically and digitally throughout Dhaka in May of that year.

        Dhaka's First Bus Map
      </h2>
      <p>
        Powered by Flocktracker and funded by Kickstarter, this project resulted in the first complete bus map of Dhaka, Bangladesh. The project was funded in part by a successful $15,000.00 <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/urbanlaunchpad/first-bus-map-of-dhaka" style="color:white">Kickstarter</a> campaign and was performed over the month of January in 2013.
